__M2 Technology Networks provides managed IT services to small, medium and large businesses.__ 

What are managed IT services? Every business relies on IT infrastructure ranging from emails to data storage. This infrastructure comes with complexities that some businesses don’t have the skills or desire to handle themselves. 

That’s where a company like M2 Technology Networks comes in.


## The Project

We were subcontracted to build out the website itself. We were provided with beautiful designs by Andrew Small Brand ID and custom-coded those designs into a responsive website that works well on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers.

Users don’t like to wait, so we used the best available technology to make sure the site was blazing fast. Less time loading means more time learning about the company, leading to more conversions. Additionally, fast load times are a ranking factor for search engines like Google, meaning that a fast site is more likely to get more search traffic.

One challenge presented by this project was the custom design. We wanted to make sure the beautiful designs (by Andrew Small Brand ID) were given the pixel-perfect representation they deserved. It was truly a pleasure to bring these excellent designs to life.

## Existing Content

One concern for the new m2technet.ca website was that it already existed before the redesign. When a website is rebuilt, it is very important to make sure all of the webpages that existed on the old website are also exist on the new website.

Why? Here are a couple of reasons:

1. Google and other search engines use that content to rank your website. Suddenly deleting or changing a URL can have a huge impact on the number of visitors coming to your website.
2. You don't want to break existing links on the web! Let's say you published a blog post, and you shared that blog post to many sites. For an old website, there might be hundreds or thousands of links leading to your website. If you break one of those links, users coming to your site might not see what they were expecting.
