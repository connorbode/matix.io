Open source software is built by the community, for the community.  The source code is made publicly available online, licensed in a way that permits everyone to use and modify it.  It is communal code.

## Who uses open source software?

Today, everyone from small startups to governments use open source software.  Need evidence? [The Government of Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en.html) is using [jQuery, an open source project](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).  In fact, [77% of the top 100,000 websites use jQuery](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery).

Most modern programmers will use open source software during every working day simply because **it makes their lives easier**!

Imagine you are cooking a meal.  Do you take a block of steel and make yourself a DIY knife?  [This guy did](https://extremehowto.com/how-to-make-a-knife/), but chances are you don't.  You take a knife, and a pot, and Google a recipe on the internet and then you cook your meal.  **You use existing tools to help you accomplish your goal.**

Programming is similar.  You can code everything from scratch, or you can re-use existing code.  Some tasks end up being so repetitive that programmers create open source software to solve the problem.

## Where can I find open source software?

The modern coder uses many open source services.  Often, projects are maintained on services like [Github](https://github.com/).  These services let users collaborate & build the open source software.  For example, you can find [the source code for the popular website platform Wordpress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) on Github.

Services like the [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/) allow programmers to easily install and use the open source software.  For example, you can find [Electron, a popular tool to build applications](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) on NPM.
