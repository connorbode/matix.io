Django is a great tool for building websites, web applications, and web APIs.  But there are many great tools out there.. how do we know Django is good?  How do we know it's not just another framework?

## Django is trusted by companies you know

Brands you know are using Django to build their platforms.  They trust Django as a framework for their systems, which are used by millions of users.  

We've chosen the top recognizable brands from [StackShare.io](https://stackshare.io/django), where companies share what technology they are using.  Beyond these companies, there are rumours that __YouTube, Spotify, NASA, the Washington Post, DropBox, Mozilla__ and others are also using Django, but we have no way of validating those claims.

So who do we know is using Django?
