VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. You've probably heard it used in one of two contexts: in the workplace, where it's used to connect to your work environment from home; and as a privacy tool, where it's usage is sometimes not clear. In this article we'll learn about both of those scenarios.

# VPNs in the workplace

If you work at an office, you probably know the following scenario.

One day, you happen to be sick. It's just a cold, but you don't want to make everyone else at work sick. You decide to work from home, but quickly realize all of your files are at work!

Normally, your laptop is able to access the files because you're logged into the work network. But from home, your laptop won't load the files.

Unable to work without them, you call into the IT department, and they get you logged into the VPN. Suddenly, you're able to access all your files.

## How does this work?

Your files are on a computer, somewhere. We'll call the computer the File Computer.

When you are at the office, your laptop knows the address of the File Computer. Your laptop can communicate with the File Computer without using the internet. Instead, it has a direct, local connection to the File Computer.

The File Computer doesn't share your files with the internet.  But, your office network and your home network are only connected through the internet. This presents a problem, which the VPN solves.

When you log into the VPN a special connection is created, over the internet, between your office network and your laptop. Your laptop is suddenly set up as though you are at work. Your laptop again knows where the File Computer is, and you can download your files.

This is all done over the internet, but in a secure way.
